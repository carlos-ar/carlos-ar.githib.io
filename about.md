		<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/Carlos_Ruvalcaba_v.jpg" alt="smiling person face image" /></span>I am an aerospace engineer by training and study the fluid mechanics of nature. As a full  time graduate student at <a href="https://ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">UC Davis</a> in the <a href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a>, I use the same modeling techiniques that help us produce flight, to study respiratory flow problems. Before beginning my graduate studies, I spent a few years working at the Boeing Company doing propulsion systems analysis. I received my Bachelor of Science from the <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu" target="_blank">Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a> at <a href="https://web.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT</a>, and Boston holds a special place in my heart.</p>

	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<p>My research interests are divided into three major areas: 1) fluid mechanics of biological systems, 2) medical device development, and 3) respiratory applications of computational methods. <span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/davis_evening.JPG" alt="Davis watertower behind trees with birds" /></span>My background has positioned my research to be both a developer of numerical modeling techniques and development of practical solutions for problems in respiratory health. My time in the <a href="https://delplanque.faculty.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Multiphase Fluid Dynamics and Thermal Sciences Laboratory</a> at UC Davis has been an absolute pleasure. Dr. Jean-Pierre Delplanque's mentorship as major professsor is unparalleled, and I thank him greatly for his time.</p>

		<p>While my research is integral to my daily activities, I strive to improve the academic life for <b>all peoples</b> of <u><em>different backgrounds</em></u>. During my time at UC Davis, I have spent my time in service to the peoples of the university by advocating as Chair of the <a href="https://gsa.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">Graduate Student Association</a>, mentoring students in my role as graduate student coordinator for <a href="https://ucleads.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">UC LEADS</a>, or helping others by sharing my path through academic and professional life.</p>
		<p>When I am not fulfilling my duties for (or at) the university, I spend many hours replicating my mother's and grandmother's cooking. They've taught me the delicate balances of flavors, with chemistry like precision, in order to serve a delicious plate from my Mexican heritage. If you are interested in sharing recipes, please feel free to contact me. I am always happy to <em>trade</em> recipes!</p>

<!-- Class elements sizing, `class = "(num1)u (num1)u` syntax is as follow
first number must be smaller than the second number, and the second number
for example 6u 12u is that the section will take 6/12 units if possible. 
Finally, we should also note that a break between each section is the second
$ sign. So a continuous row section, the first number is not broken until $-->

			<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
			<p>Much of the work that I do is open source, and I am far from a main developer of the tools that I use every day. This section is a running list of all those tools that I use to amplify my work.</p>
				<h3 id="webcredits">Website Design</h3>
				<p>I built this webpage using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> in order to make sure I could integrate IPython notebooks. This webpage's design was originally developed on <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>. The Jekyll integration was created by <a href="https://andrewbanchi.ch" target="_blank">Andrew Banchich,</a> and part of the <a href="https://github.com/andrewbanchich/editorial-jekyll-theme" target="_blank">Editorial Jekyll Theme</a>. The majority of the images are gathered from the <a href="https://unsplash.com/license" target="_blank">free-to-use</a> website, <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>. To embed YouTube videos, I've graciously borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video#responsive-videos" target="_blank">here</a>, which made this incredibly simple.</p>
				<h3 id='tool_credits'>Tools</h3>
				<p>I use a variety of tools that have helped me through my career, and some of them are listed here along with those that have developed them.</p>
				<ul class="alt">
					<li><a href="https://typora.io" target="_blank">Typora</a>, a simple markdown editor. Mainly use for my notes, and <code>README.md</code> files.</li>
					<li><a href="https://obsproject.com/wiki/Home" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a>, a free and powerful video recording and streaming platform. Useful for creating online teaching content</li>
					<li><a href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>, a powerful alternative to the Adobe CC suite, for vector image creation. Creating images for publication is probably one of the hardest things to do, but more rewarding activities.</li>
