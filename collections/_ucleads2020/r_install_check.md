Since we will be doing an installation check, you will need to run the following instructions once you have installed everything, just to make sure when we meet for the check, that things look good.

If you have any questions, please email us with your problem. As a key takeaway, please keep track of the following using either a Google Doc, Word Document, or simple text document. It is very hard for us to diagnose your problem, without knowing what you have attempted, since we cannot see your computer. The following will help:

## Preparing for the Installation Check

Make sure you visit my GitHub page ([here](https://github.com/carlos-ar/ucleads-r-programming)) to download two files:

- Jupyter Notebook with R code
- Jupyter Notebook with Python code

You can simply download these files by clicking the big green button on the top right that says: `Clone`

Once you click on the button, you should see what is below; here you want to download the `.zip` file.

### Unzipping and moving files

Once you have downloaded the files, you must unzip them, and move them to a location of your choosing. This location is important since you will need to know where to go in your Jupyter Notebook navigator, more about that later.

The only files that are relevant are:

- `python_jupyter_notebook_test.ipynb`
- `r_test.ipynb`

Notice the `.ipynb` extension, this means this is a **iPy**thon Jupyter **N**ote**b**ook, clever isn't is!

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

Since we covered opening your Jupyter Notebook navigator in the previous lesson, we will only now cover how to run this notebook. However, let's be reminded about the process to run `R` or `Python`. Click here to go back to review how to run Jupyter Notebooks using `R` or `Python`

If you downloaded the code from GitHub, and have it in a location that you trust, we can now navigate to the notebooks location, just as if you were clicking through files in your file navigator (Folders in Windows, or Finder in Mac).

In my case, I had to navigate to my notebook locations:

`projects/teaching/ucleads-r-programming/jupyter_notebooks`

Once I get to my notebooks, I should see something like below (note: you all may have deleted the `dummy.md` file, because it actually does nothing).

### Running each notebook

From here, you must determine which notebook you want to run first.
