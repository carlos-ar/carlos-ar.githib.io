# Brief Bio

I am an aerospace engineer by training and study the fluid mechanics of nature. During my graduate studies at <a href="https://ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">UC Davis</a> in the <a href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a>, I used the same modeling techniques that help us produce flight, to study respiratory flow problems.

Before beginning my graduate studies, I spent a few years working at the Boeing Company doing propulsion systems analysis. I received my Bachelor of Science from the <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu" target="_blank">Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a> at <a href="https://web.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT</a>, and Boston holds a special place in my heart.

## Spare time

When I am not fulfilling my duties for (or at) the university, I spend many hours replicating my mother's and grandmother's cooking. They've taught me the delicate balances of flavors, with chemistry like precision, in order to serve a delicious plate from my Mexican heritage. If you are interested in sharing recipes, please feel free to contact me. I am always happy to <em>trade</em> recipes!
