# Carlos' Website

I built this webpage using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in order to make sure I could integrate IPython notebooks. This webpage's design was originally developed on [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). The Jekyll integration was created by [Andrew Banchich](https://andrewbanchi.ch/), and part of the [Editorial Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/editorial-jekyll-theme). The majority of the images are gathered from the [free-to-use](https://unsplash.com/license) website, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). To embed YouTube videos, I've graciously borrowed from [here](https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video#responsive-videos), which made this incredibly simple.

# Research, Teaching, and More

My website is a collection of research projects that I work on at UC Davis, during my doctoral degree program. I also am involved in a variety of teaching endeavors, that I plan to make public over the years. This will be the primary location for those.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
